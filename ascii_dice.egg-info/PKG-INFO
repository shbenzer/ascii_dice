# ascii_dice

ascii_dice is a Python library that simulates dice rolling and Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) calculations, with support for visual ASCII representations of dice faces. The library allows for the creation and manipulation of different types of dice (e.g., D20, D6), modifiers, as well as handling advantage and disadvantage.

### Key Features:

- Ability to utilize all standard dice types (D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D16, D20)
- Ability to simulate advantage/disadvantage when rolling
- Ability to add modifiers to rolls
- Ability to include or exclude ASCII art representations of dice faces
